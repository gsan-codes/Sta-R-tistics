# Sta-R-tistics
Introduction to the basics of R and statistics with the aim of making you a statistics staR. This course is divided into modules that cover various topics: 

1. Module 1: R Basics 
      1. R Basics 1 (interfaces, RStudio, variable and data types, loading data, conditionals)
      2. R Basics 2 (order, filter, select, summarize, mutate with dplyr, loops, functions)
2. Module 2: An Introduction to Statistics 
      1. Intro to Stats 1 (Descriptive stats, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis testing, effect sizes)
      2. Intro to Stats 2 (bootstrapping, permutations, ANOVAs)
      3. Intro to Stats 3 (regression models, Hierarchical regressions, model fitting, model selection)
4. Graphing and Visualization (ggplot, heatmaps, corrplot)
5. Bayesian Statictics   

## See the tentative schedule below: 

1) Basics I (R interfaces, variables and data types, data loading) [Feb 17; 6-8pm]
2) Basics II (loops, data manipulation and summarizing, functions) [week of Feb 24; 5-7pm]<br>
[ Reading Week - NO CLASS ]<br>
3) Statistics I (descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, chi-square, effect sizes) [March 10; 5-7pm]
4) Statistics II (bootstrapping, permutations, ANOVAs) [March 17; 5-7pm]
5) Statistics III (regression models, model fitting, model selection) [March 24; 5-7pm]
6) Graphing and Visualization (ggplot, heatmaps, corrplot, etc.) [March 31; 5-7pm]<br>
[ April Exams - NO CLASS ]<br>
7) Bayesian Statistics I (comparing Bayesian vs inferential statistics) [early May]
8) Bayesian Statistics II (MCMC sampling, t-test, Bayesian regression models) [early May]
